# @saas-starter/config

Shared configuration utilities for the SaaS Starter Kit. This package primarily exports branding-related configurations (e.g., brand name, colors, logos if applicable) from `src/branding.ts` for consistent use across applications.

## Usage

This package is intended for internal use within the monorepo and is automatically available to other workspaces. Import configurations as needed:

```typescript
// Example:
// import { brandName, primaryThemeColor } from '@saas-starter/config';
```
