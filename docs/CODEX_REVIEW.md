 # CODEX Automated Review

 This document contains an automated, framework-by-framework review of how well this project conforms to the best practices and standards outlined in `docs/archive/REVIEW.md`.

 ## 1. Turborepo
 **Good**
 - Central `turbo.json` defines per-package `build`, `lint`, `dev` and deploy tasks with correct dependency graphs.
 - Persistent dev tasks and cache settings are sensible for iterative development.
 **Opportunities**
 - No remote caching configured: consider adding a remote Turborepo cache (e.g., Vercel or self-hosted) for shared CI artifacts.
 - Tighten `globalDependencies` so only intended packages see each `.env.*local` file.

 ## 2. Serverless Framework
 **Good**
 - `serverless.yml` uses `Fn::ImportValue` for cross-stack parameters, and includes plugins for warmup, offline, pruning, and env export.
 **Opportunities**
 - `custom.databasePassword` is referenced but never defined.
 - IAM statements use wildcard `Resource: '*'`; scope them to specific ARNs for principle of least privilege.
 - Package patterns include only `src/**` but exclude devDependencies to shrink Lambda bundles.

 ## 3. CDK Pipelines v2 / AWS CDK
 **Good**
 - `infrastructure/` houses a self-mutating CDK Pipelines project with stacks split by network, application, security, and shared resources.
 **Opportunities**
 - No tagging or CDK Aspects: add automated tags (cost center, owner, Git commit) via Aspects.
 - CI should run `cdk diff` and unit tests (e.g., `@aws-cdk/assertions`).
 - Avoid hard-coded region/account; use context or environment variables.

 ## 4. Expo & EAS
 **Good**
 - Dynamic `version` and `buildNumber` logic in `app.config.ts` follows Expo guidelines.
 - `eas.json` defines per-environment profiles with channels and env secrets.
 **Opportunities**
 - Sensitive `google-services*.json` files are checked into source; move to EAS secrets or CI-only artifacts.
 - Replace placeholder `projectId = "your-project-id"` with actual project ID via env or config.

 ## 5. GitHub Actions
 **Observation**
 - No `.github/workflows` directory detected. You should add Actions for lint, build, test, and deploy (Turbo, CDK, EAS).

 ## 6. Turborepo + Docker
 **Observation**
 - Dockerfile exists under `apps/backend`, but no monorepo-wide Docker/devcontainer setup. Consider a unified dev container using Turborepo caching.

 ## 7. Apollo Client
 **Observation**
 - I did not find an `<ApolloProvider>` in the Expo-Router root layout. You need to instantiate `ApolloClient` and wrap the root (e.g., in `_layout.tsx`) so generated hooks can access it.

 ## 8. Apollo Server (NestJS GraphQL)
 **Good**
 - Uses NestJS GraphQL quick-start with modules, DTOs, and code-generated schema/resolvers.
 **Opportunities**
 - Enable Playground/GraphQL Sandbox only in non-production stages.
 - Add global `ValidationPipe` for auto-request validation.
 - Validate module boundaries to avoid circular dependencies.

 ## 9. NestJS
 **Good**
 - Clear module separation (auth, config, models, etc.) and Serverless-compatible build.
 **Opportunities**
 - Leverage `@nestjs/config` with schema validation for typed env variables.
 - Add global guards (e.g., JWT) rather than per-resolver decorators.

 ## 10. Cognito
 **Good**
 - `serverless.yml` imports `UserPoolId`, `ClientId`, and grants necessary Cognito-IDP permissions.
 **Opportunities**
 - Instead of wildcard `cognito-idp:*`, restrict to only the required operations.
 - In NestJS, wrap AWS SDK calls in a dedicated service using `@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider`.

 ## 11. Gluestack / Nativewind / Tailwind
 **Good**
 - `tailwind.config.js` uses `nativewind` preset, a safelist for dynamic classes, and the Gluestack Tailwind plugin.
 - `gluestack-ui.config.json` correctly points to CSS and component dirs.
 **Opportunities**
 - Prune unused color scales to reduce bundle size.
 - Verify tree-shaking removes unused classes by inspecting production bundles.

 **Summary Recommendations**
 - Add an `ApolloProvider` in the root layout.
 - Harden Serverless IAM and packaging settings.
 - Introduce GitHub Actions workflows and remote Turborepo caching.
 - Remove sensitive JSON from source control.
 - Harden NestJS with validation, guards, config schemas, and CDK tagging.
