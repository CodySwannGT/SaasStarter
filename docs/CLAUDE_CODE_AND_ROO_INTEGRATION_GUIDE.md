## 3. Memory Management Techniques

Effective memory management is crucial for maintaining context across sessions when using AI coding assistants.

### Claude Code Memory Techniques

1. **CLAUDE.md Files**: The primary memory mechanism using Markdown files:
   - Project root (`./CLAUDE.md`): Shared with team via version control
   - Local variant (`./CLAUDE.local.md`): Personal preferences
   - Home folder (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`): Global settings

2. **Memory Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Open memory file for editing
   claude > /memory
   ```

### Roo Code Memory Management

Roo Code Memory Bank provides structured context persistence through Markdown files:

- `activeContext.md`: Current session state
- `decisionLog.md`: Technical decisions
- `productContext.md`: Project overview
- `progress.md`: Progress tracking
- `projectBrief.md`: Overall objectives
- `systemPatterns.md`: System architecture patterns

### Optimal Memory Storage Approaches

Several memory storage options are available, each with specific advantages:

1. **File-Based Storage**:
   - Simple implementation with Markdown files
   - Version control friendly
   - Manually editable

2. **SQLite Storage**:
   ```javascript
   {
     "memory": {
       "command": "npx",
       "args": ["-y", "memory-sqlite-mcp"],
       "env": {
         "DB_PATH": "/path/to/memory.db"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Excellent for medium-sized codebases
   - SQL query capabilities
   - Transactional support

3. **Vector Stores** (ChromaDB):
   ```javascript
   {
     "memory": {
       "command": "npx",
       "args": ["-y", "mcp-memory-service"],
       "env": {
         "CHROMA_DB_PATH": "/path/to/chroma_db",
         "SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD": "0.7"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Similarity-based retrieval
   - Best for natural language components

### Best Practices for Memory Management

1. Use **layered memory approach**: Project-specific files for technical details, global files for preferences
2. **Version control integration**: Commit shared memory files, gitignore personal ones
3. **Regular review and updates**: Keep memory files current with project evolution
4. **Structured organization**: Maintain consistent sections in memory files
5. For large codebases, implement **domain partitioning** by separating memory files by module

## 4. Model Context Protocol (MCP): The Integration Foundation

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the key to integrating Claude Code and Roo Code, providing a standardized way for both tools to interact with external systems and share context.

### What is MCP?

MCP acts as a universal connector between AI systems and external tools, similar to how USB-C provides a standardized way to connect devices:

- **Client-Server Architecture**: Both Claude Code and Roo Code act as MCP clients that connect to MCP servers
- **Standardized Communication**: All messages follow JSON-RPC 2.0 specifications
- **Transport Mechanisms**: Supports stdio (local) and SSE (remote) communication

### MCP Capabilities

MCP servers provide three main types of functionality:

1. **Tools**: Functions that can be called to perform actions
2. **Resources**: Data sources that can be read 
3. **Prompts**: Templates that help guide AI responses

MCP replaces custom-built connectors with a single, standardized protocol, allowing both Claude Code and Roo Code to access the same ecosystem of tools.

## 5. Integration Strategies Between Claude Code and Roo Code

### Configuring MCP for Both Tools

#### Claude Code MCP Configuration

Claude Code uses a command-line approach for MCP configuration:

```bash
# Add an MCP server
claude mcp add <server-name> <command> [args...]

# Example
claude mcp add memory-bank -e MEMORY_PATH=/path/to/memory -- npx -y memory-bank-mcp-server
```

Or configure directly in `.claude.json` or `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-bank": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "memory-bank-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_PATH": "/path/to/memory"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Roo Code MCP Configuration

Roo Code manages MCP configurations in VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-bank": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "memory-bank-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_PATH": "/path/to/memory"
      },
      "alwaysAllow": ["memory_bank_read"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Shared Memory Between Tools

To enable both tools to share memory, use an MCP memory server:

1. **Set up a shared memory MCP server**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-bank": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "memory-bank-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_BANK_ROOT": "/path/to/shared/memory-bank"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Configure this same server in both tools**

3. **Point both to the same storage location**

### Shared MCP Configurations

#### Strategy 1: Version-Controlled Configuration Files

Create a single source of truth in your repository:

```
project-root/
├── .mcp.json           # Claude Code project config
├── .roo/mcp.json       # Roo Code project config
└── .mcp-shared/        # Shared configuration details
    ├── servers/        # Server-specific configs
    └── prompts/        # Shared prompts
```

#### Strategy 2: Synchronization Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# sync-mcp-config.sh

# Extract core configuration
jq '.mcpServers' .mcp.json > .mcp-shared/servers.json

# Update Roo Code configuration
mkdir -p .roo
jq '{mcpServers: input}' .mcp-shared/servers.json > .roo/mcp.json

# Update Claude Code configuration
jq --slurpfile servers .mcp-shared/servers.json \
   '.mcpServers = $servers[0]' .claude.json > .claude.json.new && \
   mv .claude.json.new .claude.json
```

### Shared Ignore Patterns/Files

#### Using .gitignore as the Foundation

1. Maintain a comprehensive `.gitignore` at your project root
2. Reference it in both tools' configurations:

For Claude Code in `.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "ignorePatterns": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "additional": [
      ".claude-private/"
    ]
  }
}
```

For Roo Code in `.roo/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "ignorePatterns": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "additional": [
      ".roo-private/"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Dedicated MCP Ignore File

Create a `.mcpignore` file:

```
# Shared ignore patterns for Claude Code and Roo Code
node_modules/
venv/
.env
.env.*
*.log
.DS_Store
tmp/
.cache/

# Tool-specific private directories
.claude-private/
.roo-private/
```

### Shared Modes and Role Definitions

Create common role definitions in a shared configuration:

```json
{
  "roles": {
    "architect": {
      "description": "System architecture and design expert",
      "capabilities": ["read", "command", "mcp"],
      "customInstructions": "Focus on architecture and design patterns."
    },
    "coder": {
      "description": "Implementation specialist",
      "capabilities": ["read", "edit", "command", "mcp"],
      "customInstructions": "Implement features based on established architecture."
    },
    "reviewer": {
      "description": "Code review and quality assurance",
      "capabilities": ["read", "command", "mcp"],
      "customInstructions": "Focus on identifying bugs and code quality improvements."
    }
  }
}
```

Map these to tool-specific configurations:

For Claude Code, set up custom commands:
```bash
# Create architect mode command
echo "You are now in Architect mode. $(cat .mcp-shared/roles/architect.md)" > \
  .claude/commands/architect.md
```

For Roo Code, use a modes MCP server:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "modes": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/modes-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "MODES_CONFIG_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/.mcp-shared/roles/modes.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Minimizing Configuration Duplication

#### Using Symbolic Links

```bash
# Create the primary configuration in Claude Code
mkdir -p .claude/mcp/servers
cp server-configs/* .claude/mcp/servers/

# Link to Roo Code
mkdir -p .roo/mcp/servers
ln -s $(pwd)/.claude/mcp/servers/* .roo/mcp/servers/
```

#### Using Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:
```
MCP_MEMORY_PATH=/path/to/shared/memory
MCP_DATABASE_URI=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db
```

Reference in both tools' configurations:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["memory-bank", "mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_PATH": "${env:MCP_MEMORY_PATH}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
