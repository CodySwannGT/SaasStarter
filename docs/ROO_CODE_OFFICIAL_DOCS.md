## Installation

### VS Code Marketplace (Recommended)
1. Open VS Code
2. Click the Extensions icon or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS)
3. Search for "Roo Code"
4. Click Install
5. Find the Roo Code icon (ü¶ò) in the Activity Bar

### Alternative Installation Methods
- **Open VSX Registry**: For VS Code-compatible editors like VSCodium
- **Manual VSIX**: Download from marketplace and drag into editor

## Configuration

### API Providers
RooCode supports multiple AI providers:
- Anthropic (Claude)
- OpenAI (GPT models)
- OpenRouter
- Google (Gemini)
- AWS Bedrock
- Azure OpenAI
- Ollama (local models)
- And more...

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP extends RooCode's capabilities by allowing integration with external tools and services.

#### Key Features of MCP:
- **Standardized Protocol**: Universal adapter between AI and various data sources
- **Tool Discovery**: AI can automatically discover and use available tools
- **Stateful Context**: Maintains conversation context across tool uses
- **Extensible**: Add unlimited custom tools

#### MCP Configuration
MCP servers can be configured at two levels:
1. **Global Configuration**: In `mcp_settings.json` file
2. **Project Configuration**: In `.roo/mcp.json` file

Example MCP configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your_api_key"
      },
      "alwaysAllow": ["tool1", "tool2"],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

#### Transport Types:
- **STDIO**: Local servers communicating via standard input/output
- **SSE**: Remote servers using Server-Sent Events

## Customization Options

### Custom Instructions
Configure RooCode's behavior using:
- **Global Instructions**: Apply across all workspaces
- **Workspace Instructions**: Project-specific settings
- **Mode-specific Instructions**: Tailored for each mode

#### Rule Files:
- `.roorules`: Primary configuration file
- `.clinerules`: Alternative naming
- `.cursorrules` / `.windsurfrules`: For compatibility

Example structure:
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .roorules                    # Workspace-wide rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .roorules-code              # Code mode specific
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .roorules-architect         # Architect mode specific
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .roo/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp.json                # MCP configuration
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rules-code/             # Mode-specific rules directory
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style-guide.md
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testing-rules.md
```

### Custom Modes
Create specialized AI assistants with:
- Custom role definitions
- Specific tool permissions
- File access restrictions
- Tailored instructions

Example custom mode configuration:
```json
{
  "slug": "docs-writer",
  "name": "Documentation Writer",
  "roleDefinition": "You are a technical documentation expert...",
  "groups": [
    ["read", {}],
    ["edit", { "fileRegex": "\\.(md|mdx)$" }]
  ],
  "customInstructions": "Always use clear, concise language..."
}
```

## Usage Tips

### Switching Modes
1. **Dropdown Menu**: Click selector next to chat input
2. **Slash Commands**: Type `/code`, `/architect`, `/ask`, etc.
3. **Keyboard Shortcut**: 
   - macOS: `‚åò + .`
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + .`

### Best Practices
- Be clear and specific in your requests
- Use mode switching for different tasks
- Review and approve actions before execution
- Enable auto-approval cautiously
- Use custom instructions for consistency
- Leverage MCP for external integrations

### Performance Optimization
- Turn off MCP if not needed to reduce prompt size
- Adjust file truncation settings for large files
- Use appropriate context window sizes
- Consider model selection per mode

## Security Considerations

- RooCode can access your file system and execute commands
- MCP servers can run arbitrary code
- Always review actions before approval
- Be cautious with auto-approval settings
- Only use trusted MCP servers
- Consider security implications of web browsing features

## Advanced Features

### Sticky Models
Each mode remembers your last-used model, automatically switching between them as you change modes.

### Tool Permissions
Control what each mode can do:
- Read files
- Write/edit files
- Execute commands
- Browse web
- Use MCP tools

### File Restrictions
Limit file access using regex patterns:
```json
{
  "fileRegex": "\\.(md|mdx|txt)$",
  "description": "Only markdown and text files"
}
```
