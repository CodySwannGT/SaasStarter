   - Optimize Lambda functions

## Architecture Decisions and Questions

Below are key architecture decisions and open questions for the project:

### Decisions Made
- **Monorepo and Package Management**: Using Turborepo for optimization and Bun for faster builds
- **Authentication Provider**: AWS Cognito with abstraction layer for flexibility
- **Multi-tenancy Approach**: Shared database with tenant ID for simplicity and cost-efficiency
- **Mobile Platform**: Expo/React Native with responsive web support

### Open Questions
1. **CI/CD Setup**: Should each repo have its own pipeline or is one central pipeline for the monorepo better?
2. **Environment Variables**: Do we have a comprehensive list of required environment variables and their sources?
3. **Configuration Centralization**: What configuration should be moved to the shared packages?
4. **Documentation Approach**: Should docs be mainly in a central `/docs` folder or distributed in each app?
5. **Root Configuration**: What files should not be at the root level? (lint configs, tsconfig, etc.)

## Implementation Best Practices

### TypeScript Configuration
- Enable strict mode in all tsconfig files
- Configure paths for module resolution
- Use project references for better type checking

### API Development
- Use code-first GraphQL approach with NestJS
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Ensure consistent naming conventions for resolvers and services

### Frontend Development
- Follow the Container/View pattern for components
- Use responsive design for cross-platform compatibility
- Implement proper state management and data fetching strategies

### Security Practices
- Never hardcode sensitive information
- Implement proper validation for all user inputs
- Use proper authentication and authorization checks
- Follow least privilege principle for permissions

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Add E2E tests for critical user flows
- Use mock services for external dependencies

## Common Development Tasks

### Setting Up Local Environment
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `bun install` to install dependencies
3. Create a `.env` file with required environment variables
4. Run `bun run dev` to start the development server

### Creating New Features
1. Determine if the feature should be in frontend, backend, or both
2. Follow the established patterns in the respective codebase
3. Add proper tests for the new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed

### Deploying Changes
1. Run the linting and tests with `bun run lint && bun run test`
2. Create a pull request with your changes
3. After review and approval, merge to the main branch
4. The CI/CD pipeline will handle the deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build failures**: Check TypeScript errors, run `bun run typecheck`
- **API errors**: Verify GraphQL schema, check resolver implementations
- **Frontend rendering issues**: Check component props and state management
- **Authentication problems**: Verify Cognito setup and token handling

### Getting Help
- Check the documentation in the `/docs` directory
- Review the codebase for similar implementations
- Ask questions in the designated communication channels
