# UI Component Restructuring PRD

## Overview

The current frontend architecture lacks consistent UI component reusability. Instead of leveraging the available gluestack-ui components, developers are creating custom implementations with direct className usage. This leads to inconsistency, maintenance challenges, and poor code reuse.

## Goals

1. Restructure the UI component architecture to maximize reusability
2. Create a clear separation between gluestack components and custom components
3. Minimize direct Tailwind className usage outside of component definitions
4. Establish a clear pattern for extending or customizing gluestack components
5. Provide documentation and examples to ensure developer adoption

## Requirements

### Component Organization

- Move all existing UI components from `/components` to appropriate locations:
  - Gluestack components should be in `/components/ui`
  - Custom UI components should be in `/components/custom/ui`
  - Feature-specific components should remain in `/features`

### Component Implementation

- Custom UI components should leverage gluestack components internally
- Direct Tailwind className usage should be limited to component definitions
- Component props should be properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
- Components should follow the Container/View pattern as per existing project structure

### Documentation

- Create clear documentation for the component hierarchy
- Provide usage examples for all component types
- Document best practices for component extension and customization

### Migration Strategy

- Identify existing components for refactoring
- Create a migration path that minimizes disruption to ongoing development
- Establish guidelines for maintaining backward compatibility

## Technical Specifications

### Gluestack Integration

- Use gluestack-ui v2 as documented at https://gluestack.io/ui/docs/
- Leverage the component composition pattern provided by gluestack
- Ensure all components work across web and native platforms

### Custom Component Guidelines

- Custom components should be thin wrappers around gluestack components
- They should add business-specific styling and behavior
- They must support light/dark mode themes
- They should handle responsive design appropriately

### Testing Requirements

- All refactored components should have unit tests
- Visual regression tests should be added for key components
- Test coverage should be maintained at current levels or improved

## Success Criteria

1. Decreased code duplication in UI implementations
2. Increased consistency in UI appearance and behavior
3. Improved developer productivity when creating new screens
4. Simplified maintenance of UI components
5. Comprehensive test coverage for component library
