/**
 * This file exports all custom UI components from /components/custom/ui
 *
 * These components build on top of the base gluestack components to provide
 * additional functionality and styling specific to this application.
 *
 * Component naming follows the pattern:
 * - Component names are PascalCase (e.g., Card, SearchInput)
 * - Each component has a named export
 *
 * Import example:
 * import { Card, SearchInput } from '@/components/custom/ui';
 */

// Example component exports (uncomment and add your actual components)
// export { default as Card } from './Card';
// export { default as SearchInput } from './SearchInput';
// export { default as FormField } from './FormField';

// Export component template for reference (remove in production)
export { default as ComponentTemplate } from "./ComponentTemplate";
