## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**Before submitting a bug report**:
- Check the [issues](../../issues) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

**Before submitting an enhancement suggestion**:
- Check if the enhancement has already been suggested.
- Determine which repository the enhancement should be suggested in.
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

* `documentation`: Improvements or additions to documentation
* `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
* `help wanted`: Extra attention is needed
